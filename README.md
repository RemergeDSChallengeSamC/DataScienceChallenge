# Remerge Data Science Challenge

### Contents

	* present_results.ipynb 

            general presentation of the steps taken and results
	
	* train_and_evaluate.py
		
            functions to train classifiers on each day of processed records
                make predictions on subsequent days 
                save the prediction results at each training iteration for later evaluation

### Dependencies

No packages outside of the Python standard library are used here except for my own model evaluation module -- only numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. Ergo no conda requirements file.

### Note

I didn't include the feature engineering modules that I wrote for this or my model evaluation module because I think this is valuable work. 

However, I would be glad for the opportunity to share them with your team in the future and find out if and how they could be useful for you.
